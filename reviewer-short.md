# A Guide to Paper Reviewing for NIME (Condensed)

This is the abridged version of the larger [Guide to Paper Reviewing for NIME](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kv4i4v58nnapLwXbZI9jkv3g_4u5Y1Q9Bl8r-HXUH-k/edit?usp=sharing). 

## The most important question

Reviews are an essential part of the feedback to NIME authors. The central, guiding question for all reviews is this: 

**Does this submission present a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge?** 

## A useful perspective for NIME reviews

NIME is unique in that it offers a multi-faceted perspective on not only how, but why and what it means to make music with computers. The NIME community includes those with diverse backgrounds, such as technologists, academics, artists, musicians, experimental practitioners, theorists, and many more. Additionally, the practice of NIME community members often lies across many of these areas, and extends into many more besides. 

For this reason, it’s important to approach NIME reviews with the perspective of the community \- for example, a paper may not be the kind of work you like, or what you’re used to seeing; this does not mean it automatically merits a low score. Instead, we ask reviewers to approach every submission with an open mind and intellectual generosity, and decide **whether the submission presents a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge.**

## Writing a NIME review

### Read the submission

It seems self-explanatory, but it’s important to read the submission, in its entirety. Some useful questions to ask yourself while you read:

- What’s the central idea in this paper? Is it clear?  
- What’s the contribution that this paper makes?  
- Is the contribution unique? (This doesn’t mean it’s never been written about before, but rather that there’s something here that is singular \- that could be an implementation, a technical aspect, an evaluation technique, a theoretical perspective, an artistic take, etc)  
- Does the contribution add value to the NIME body of knowledge?

#### An important note about bias

In recent years the topic of bias has come to the forefront in peer review, and NIME of course is not immune to the effects of conscious and unconscious bias.

While this document can’t give prescriptive guidelines on how to avoid bias, please keep in mind that we all have our own expectations of NIME work that is “good”, “useful”, and “relevant”. However, NIME is an enormous and diverse community that lies across divergent disciplines, and you may encounter submissions that you don’t personally find useful or relevant. In this case, we encourage all reviewers to keep in mind that our judgement should be based on **enhancing** **community knowledge**.

**Also, contributions will come from very different research traditions (qualitative, quantitative, design-based and artistic research, etc). It is sometimes difficult for the paper chairs to match reviewer background to papers, so please keep an eye open for critical mismatches, and let us know if you are asked to review a submission that comes from a research tradition or paradigm that you are not comfortable reviewing.**

### Write the review

Reviews are an important way to offer the author feedback on their work \- telling them what was positive, what could use improvement, and how you see this work as contributing to community knowledge.

These are the goals of reviewing:

1. To point out the strengths of the submission  
2. To identify possible weaknesses of the submission  
3. To offer feedback on what would improve the submission  
4. To offer a perspective on whether the submission makes a valid, meaningful contribution to the NIME field of knowledge.

Please note: The goal of reviews is not to eliminate papers from consideration. Rather, it is to help identify the papers that offer important contributions to community knowledge.

#### 1: Summarise the paper.

Writing a few sentences summarising the paper is a great way to start. It demonstrates to the author that you read and considered the paper, and is a good jumping-off point for your own thoughts.

#### 2: Summarise the positives.

Every paper, no matter how lacking, has positive aspects \- maybe it’s well written, or it provides an excellent bibliography, or contains great documentation or illustrations. 

#### 3: Summarise the negatives, and suggest ways that these might be improved.

Summarise any negative aspects, and suggest ways that these might be improved. It’s important to remember that authors are doing their best, and this section is usually the most 

#### 4: State your rating, and give a justification.

Finally, state your recommendation (Accept, Weak Accept, Weak Reject, or Reject). Clearly state why you are making this recommendation. Please take a moment to contextualise this rating within the question that guides our decisions for NIME content: ***Does this submission present a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge? Why or why not?***

### An example review

Below is an example of a useful review. 

*This paper is on the usefulness of thematic analysis in instrument evaluation. The authors performed a thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews of six experimental musicians. Through this method, they found that there were new insights that are not captured by other methods such as surveys.*

*This submission provides a solid primer on thematic analysis and how it can be applied to the evaluation of NIME work. The method is rigorous, and the authors demonstrate their deep engagement with thematic analysis.*

*That said, there are some drawbacks to this work. First of all, the authors do not engage with NIME work that has used this method before. \[Give examples.\] Citing some of these works in the Background would communicate awareness of this work, and provide an opportunity for the authors to explain how this method is different. Secondly, while the claim that new insights are possible that go beyond what’s able to be captured by surveys is a very interesting claim, they don’t demonstrate that this is the case; there is no comparison of surveys vs thematic analysis, for example. Unfortunately this is the main push of this paper, and I don’t see it as well supported.*

*For this reason, I submit an evaluation of Weak Reject. This is because there is already ample work on using thematic analysis for instrument evaluation, and this submission does not go beyond that existing work, except with the claim of better insights which is unfortunately unsupported.*

### Review FAQs

#### What’s the role of anonymity in the reviewing process?

The NIME review process is double-blind. This means that the authors don’t know who the reviewers are, 

#### What should I do if I recognise the work I’m being asked to review?

When you volunteer for reviewing you are asked to state your conflicts of interest, meaning people that you work closely with now, or those you’ve worked closely with in the past. Though we aim to avoid assigning reviews with which a reviewer can have a conflict, it can happen.

If this happens, email the meta-reviewer. You might still be able to review the paper, but ultimately this decision will be up to the meta-reviewer.

#### What should I do if I feel completely unqualified to assess this submission?

Though we try to match the specialisation of reviewers to the submissions, you might get a review on a subject you don’t know very much about, or one using methods or coming from a research tradition you are not familiar with or comfortable evaluating.

Here good reviews are essential\! A summary of the paper, what you understand from it as someone without expertise in this area, and what you see as strengths and weaknesses is very useful and provides important author feedback.

If you are really not comfortable reviewing it because doing so requires specific topical or methodological expertise, please contact your meta-reviewer or the paper chairs.

#### How long should a review be?

There’s no minimum or maximum length for reviews, but reviews have a recommended structure: It should summarise the paper’s topic and main points, state the positive and negative aspects, and offer a recommendation for acceptance with a well-articulated reasoning for that recommendation. 

Typically, this is 200-500 words. However, you are free to use as much space as you think is necessary.

#### If the paper is great, do I need to submit a detailed review?

Yes\! Authors depend on feedback, and explaining why you thought something was great is as important as a less positive critique.

Just as importantly, your review is important to the meta-reviewer, who will be making a final recommendation. They are keenly interested in your feedback and perspective, and this helps them make acceptance decisions that include a wide range of perspectives.

#### What happens if the paper content is interesting, but the writing isn’t good?

We ask that reviewers focus on the *content* of the paper. Meta-reviewers will make the call about whether the writing is a factor.

Please note: In recent years there has been an effort within NIME to offer peer proofreading, to include submissions from people whose English is not their first language but whose content makes important contributions. After review, meta-reviewers will decide whether the paper should undergo proofreading. 

#### What makes a paper unreviewable?

Papers are rejected at the beginning of the process (known as a “desk reject”) for the following reasons:

- The authors names are included (ie, the paper is not anonymised)  
- The paper is not submitted in English  
- The paper is obviously not complete (ie, section headings but no content)  
- The paper has clear ethical issues (ie, the study creates some clear danger for participant, or no previous ethical approval was obtained)

These are the only situations in which there can be a desk rejection. Otherwise, the paper goes to review.

#### What happens if I don’t submit a review?

Since NIME is dependent on reviews to select the proceedings, we ask you to please, please submit your reviews if you have committed to reviewing for this year’s NIME.

If for some reason reviewing is impossible, please tell your meta-reviewer as soon as possible so another reviewer can  be found.

#### Can the results of the reviewing process be contested? 

Since NIME is a small conference with limited resources, we don’t offer a rebuttal phase for reviews. Once the reviews are released, the decisions are final.
