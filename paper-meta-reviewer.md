# A Guide to Paper Meta-Reviewing for NIME

Thank you for agreeing to be a meta-reviewer for NIME 2025 ! This guide is to make the meta-reviewing process less time consuming. If you still have questions, please contact the paper chairs, Doga Buse Cavdir (dogc@itu.dk) or Florent Berthaut (florent.berthaut@univ-lille.fr)

## Who are meta-reviewers?

**Meta-reviewers** are experienced NIME scholars and artists with considerable domain knowledge and reviewing experience. Meta-reviewers consider the reviewers' perspectives and their own assessment of a submission to _make an acceptance recommendation to the track chairs_. Meta-reviewers do not simply _average_ reviewers' scores but can engage the reviewers in discussion as well as contribute their own perspective to either reach a consensus, or articulate the differing review perspectives and ensure that feedback to authors is appropriate.

## A useful perspective for NIME reviews

NIME is unique in that it offers a multi-faceted perspective on not only how, but why and what it means to make music with computers. The NIME community includes those with diverse backgrounds, such as technologists, academics, artists, musicians, experimental practitioners, theorists, and many more. Additionally, the practice of NIME community members often lies across many of these areas, and extends into many more besides. 

For this reason, it’s important to approach NIME reviews with the perspective of the community \- for example, a paper may not be the kind of work you like, or what you’re used to seeing; this does not mean it automatically merits a low score. Instead, we ask reviewers to approach every submission with an open mind and intellectual generosity, and decide **whether the submission presents a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge.**

## The NIME meta-review process

### After submission: Meta-reviews assigned

After the call closes, the paper chairs assign meta-reviewers. Meta-reviewers are experienced members of the NIME community who have extensive scholarly experience, as well as experience submitting/presenting at NIME.

When you receive an invite to be a meta-reviewer, please click the “accept” link to confirm your participation in the CMT.

### Reviews Assigned

As a meta-reviewers you won’t have to find a group of reviewers; these will be assigned for you.  
There is some time between the submission deadline and the reviews being assigned, because the paper chairs have to set that up. This is typically about a week, though it does change depending on the chairs, the number of reviews, the available reviewers, and so on. You’ll get an email when the reviews have been assigned, and you can submit your reviews any time between then and the review deadline.

### Review process

Typically the review process lasts 3-4 weeks. In this time the reviewers should submit their reviews. 

As a meta-reviewer, it’s your responsibility to contact reviewers and remind them of the review deadline if their reviews are not submitted. By the review deadline their reviews should be complete (score, as well as written review). Meeting this deadline is very important.

### Assembling the reviews and writing the meta-review

After the reviews are in, the meta-reviewers have about a week to read the submitted reviews, engage in discussions with reviewers in case of disagreements, and write the meta-review (a guide to writing a meta-review is in the next section).

## Writing a NIME meta-review

Meta-reviews are an important influence on chair decisions for the work that should be included in this year’s NIME proceedings. These reviews are also an essential part of the feedback to authors. 

The central, guiding question for all reviews \- meta or otherwise \- is this:

**Does this submission present a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge?** 

With this question in mind, here’s a guide to writing a NIME meta-review

### Read the submission

It seems self-explanatory, but it’s important to read the submission, in its entirety. Some useful questions to ask yourself while you read:

- What’s the central idea in this paper? Is it clear?  
- What’s the contribution that this paper makes?  
- Is the contribution unique? (This doesn’t mean it’s never been written about before, but rather that there’s something here that is singular \- that could be an implementation, a technical aspect, an evaluation technique, a theoretical perspective, an artistic take, etc)  
- Does the contribution add value to the NIME body of knowledge?

#### An important note about bias

In recent years the topic of bias has come to the forefront in peer review, and NIME of course is not immune to the effects of conscious and unconscious bias.

While this document can’t give prescriptive guidelines on how to avoid bias, please keep in mind that we all have our own expectations of NIME work that is “good”, “useful”, and “relevant”. However, NIME is an enormous and diverse community that lies across divergent disciplines, and you may encounter submissions that you don’t personally find useful or relevant. In this case, we encourage all reviewers to keep in mind that our judgement should be based on **enhancing** **community knowledge**.

**Also, contributions will come from very different research traditions (qualitative, quantitative, design-based and artistic research, etc). It is sometimes difficult for the paper chairs to match reviewer background to papers, so please keep an eye open for critical mismatches, and let us know if you are asked to review a submission that comes from a research tradition or paradigm that you are not comfortable reviewing.**

### Read the reviews

After reading the paper, read the reviews. A guide has been given to reviewers about how to write a good review. Don’t just look at the score, also carefully consider the written review.

#### When discussions should be initiated

Discussions should be started if there are serious discrepancies between scores. For example if Reviewer \#1 rates a paper 5, Reviewer \#2 rates it 4, and Reviewer \#3 rates it 1, a discussion should be initiated so you, as a meta-reviewer, can understand the reasoning of all reviewers and use that to inform your recommendation. As your review has considerable influence, it’s important to fully understand, consider and synthesise the reviewers’ perspectives so your meta-review reflects not only your own expertise but the opinions of the reviewers.

### Writing the meta-review

Reviews are an important way to offer the author feedback on their work \- telling them what was positive, what could use improvement, and how you see this work as contributing to community knowledge.

These are the goals of reviewing:

1. To point out the strengths of the submission  
2. To identify possible weaknesses of the submission  
3. To offer feedback on what would improve the submission  
4. To offer a perspective on whether the submission makes a valid, meaningful contribution to the NIME field of knowledge.

Please note: The goal of reviews is not to eliminate papers from consideration. Rather, it is to help identify the papers that offer important contributions to community knowledge.

#### 1: Summarise the paper.

Writing a few sentences summarising the paper is a great way to start. It demonstrates to the author that you read and considered the paper, and is a good jumping-off point for your own thoughts.

#### 2: Summarise the positives.

Every paper, no matter how lacking, has positive aspects \- maybe it’s well written, or it provides an excellent bibliography, or contains great documentation or illustrations. 

**A meta-review should summarise the positives pointed out by each reviewer, as well as any additional strengths identified by you.**

#### 3: Summarise the negatives, and suggest ways that these might be improved.

Summarise any negative aspects, and suggest ways that these might be improved.

**A meta-review should summarise the weak points pointed out by each reviewer, as well as any additional areas for improvement identified by you.**

#### 4: State your rating, and give a justification.

Finally, state your recommendation (Accept, Weak Accept, Weak Reject, or Reject). Clearly state why you are making this recommendation, and make sure that you take into account the opinions of the reviewers. For example, if your reviewers score a paper 3, 3, and 4 but you think it’s a very good and important work, state why you think so and what this unique and important contribution to the NIME community is. This meta-review is helpful for the author, but it’s also very important for the chairs to understand your recommendation. 

### An example review

Below is an example of a useful meta-review. 

*This paper is on the usefulness of thematic analysis in instrument evaluation. The authors performed a thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews of six experimental musicians. Through this method, they found that there were new insights that are not captured by other methods such as surveys.*

*This work has several strong points. For example, Reviewers 1 and 2 point out that this submission provides a solid primer on thematic analysis and how it can be applied to the evaluation of NIME work. Reviewer 1 adds that the method is rigorous, and the authors demonstrate their deep engagement with thematic analysis. I agree with these assessments.*

*That said, the reviewers pointed out several drawbacks to this work. First of all, all reviewers mentioned that the authors do not engage with NIME work that has used this method before. \[Give examples.\] Reviewer 2 suggests that citing some of these works in the Background would communicate awareness of this work, and provide an opportunity for the authors to explain how this method is different. Secondly, Reviewers 1 and 2 add that while the authors claim that new insights are possible that go beyond what’s able to be captured by surveys, there is no comparison of methods in order to make a credible claim. Though I don’t think that this demonstration is strictly necessary in every case, unfortunately this is the main stated contribution of this paper, and I agree that this claim is not well supported.*

*For this reason, my recommendation for this paper is Reject. This is because there is already ample work on using thematic analysis for instrument evaluation, and this submission does not go beyond that existing work, except with the claim of better insights which is unfortunately unsupported. I encourage the authors to read the insightful and important critiques submitted by the reviewers, and to re-submit this work in the future \- there is a kernel of a good idea here, and with more support of the paper’s claims (or an alternative framing) this could be a very useful contribution.*

## Outline of the meta review questions and considerations

The meta review consists of 10 questions which address summarisation of the reviewers’ comments, own perspective, and recommendations for the paper in the conference. As a brief overview:

**1\. (Final Decision to be displayed to Authors) After careful deliberation by our volunteer reviewers and the Paper Chairs, your submission has been given the following status:**

**Type: Options**  
**Reject**  
**Accept**  
**Accept as different presentation format**  
**Conditional Accept**

Meta reviewers should select their decision **to be displayed to Authors** \- this is done preliminarily at the point of meta review but may be reconsidered or discussed with the Paper Chairs in the case of any irreconcilable reviewer feedback.

**2\. (Final Meta Review to be displayed to Authors) Please enter a summary of the referees' reviews for the submission:**

**Type: Comment**

Meta reviewers should provide a summary of the referees’ reviews here as a synopsis of the reviews, to be displayed to Authors.

**3\. (To be displayed to Authors) Please enter your review/meta-review here: \***

**Type: Comment**

Meta reviewers should enter their meta review here, reflective of their overall position and including perspectives from the other referees.

Meta reviewers should indicate the decision for the paper \- to reject, accept, accept in a different format, or a conditional accept\* \- in the case of conditional accept, this must be justified in Q7

**4\. Please indicate a score for your review (your overall opinion, including perspectives from the other referees) \***

**Type: Options with value**

* **Strong reject**  
* **Lean reject**  
* **Lean accept**  
* **Strong accept**


This is the rating for your review; not equivalent with a recommendation, as above in Q4, but your overall assessment of the paper. This question helps to justify Q4 from your perspective as meta reviewer; e.g., a paper may be *Q4 \= Accept* and *Q6 \= Strong accept* to highlight the quality, but may also be something like *Q4 \= Accept as different presentation format* and *Q6 \= Strong accept.*

**5\. Please enter justification for your decision here (this will NOT be shared with the authors but only visible to the NIME chairs) \***

**Type: Comment**

Meta reviewers should comment on this decision to the NIME chairs \- this can be simple as agreement with the reviewers or other perspectives that should be considered in this decision.

**6\. Use this box if you are recommending this paper as "Accept as different presentation format" or "Conditional Accept." Please state why this is the case, and what specifically what the authors must do before the camera ready deadline in the case of Conditional Accept. Papers with conditional accept will need a final confirmation before being accepted.**  
**(Visible to Authors and Reviewers)**

**Type: Comment**

This option should be used if you indicate Conditional Accept or Accept as different presentation format: If you are recommending a paper be conditionally accepted, you must highlight why this is the case (e.g., the paper has high value and rigour and you feel should be included, but it is missing a key consideration or clarification in order to be accepted/the paper fits into a different format. However, the consideration can be easily addressed within the camera ready timeline without additional research being done). This must be justified to Paper Chairs and papers with conditional accept will need a final confirmation before being confirmed accept.

**7\. (Optional, to be shared with Authors) Are any changes required to the paper format? (e.g. length, formatting, ethics statement)**

**Type: Comment**

Meta reviewers should note cosmetic or formatting concerns, missing ethics statements, and length adjustments to make \- this may apply to any paper category, but should be cases where the concern does not interfere with the overall quality of the paper (e.g., the paper is of good quality and rigour but references need to be cleaned up).

**8\. (Optional) Please enter any comments for the NIME chairs (this will NOT be shared with the authors)**

**Type: Comment**

Anything else the Paper Chairs should consider \- can be written confidentially to us.

## Review FAQs

### What’s the role of anonymity in the reviewing process?

The NIME review process is double-blind. This means that the authors don’t know who the reviewers are, 

### What should I do if I recognise the work I’m being asked to review?

When you volunteer for reviewing you are asked to state your conflicts of interest, meaning people that you work closely with now, or those you’ve worked closely with in the past. Though we aim to avoid assigning reviews with which a reviewer can have a conflict, it can happen.

If this happens, email the meta-reviewer. You might still be able to review the paper, but ultimately this decision will be up to the meta-reviewer.

### What should I do if I feel completely unqualified to assess this submission?

Though we try to match the specialisation of reviewers to the submissions, you might get a review on a subject you don’t know very much about, or one using methods or coming from a research tradition you are not familiar with or comfortable evaluating.

Here good reviews are essential\! A summary of the paper, what you understand from it as someone without expertise in this area, and what you see as strengths and weaknesses is very useful and provides important author feedback.

If you are really not comfortable reviewing it because doing so requires specific topical or methodological expertise, please contact your meta-reviewer or the paper chairs.

### How long should a review be?

There’s no minimum or maximum length for reviews, but reviews have a recommended structure: It should summarise the paper’s topic and main points, state the positive and negative aspects, and offer a recommendation for acceptance with a well-articulated reasoning for that recommendation. 

Typically, this is 200-500 words. However, you are free to use as much space as you think is necessary.

### If the paper is great, do I need to submit a detailed review?

Yes\! Authors depend on feedback, and explaining why you thought something was great is as important as a less positive critique.

Just as importantly, your review is important to the meta-reviewer, who will be making a final recommendation. They are keenly interested in your feedback and perspective, and this helps them make acceptance decisions that include a wide range of perspectives.

### What happens if the paper content is interesting, but the writing isn’t good?

We ask that reviewers focus on the *content* of the paper. Meta-reviewers will make the call about whether the writing is a factor.

Please note: In recent years there has been an effort within NIME to offer peer proofreading, to include submissions from people whose English is not their first language but whose content makes important contributions. After review, meta-reviewers will decide whether the paper should undergo proofreading. 

### What makes a paper unreviewable?

Papers are rejected at the beginning of the process (known as a “desk reject”) for the following reasons:

- The authors names are included (ie, the paper is not anonymised)  
- The paper is not submitted in English  
- The paper is obviously not complete (ie, section headings but no content)  
- The paper has clear ethical issues (ie, the study creates some clear danger for participant, or no previous ethical approval was obtained)

These are the only situations in which there can be a desk rejection. Otherwise, the paper goes to review.

### What happens if I don’t submit a review?

Since NIME is dependent on reviews to select the proceedings, we ask you to please, please submit your reviews if you have committed to reviewing for this year’s NIME.

If for some reason reviewing is impossible, please tell your meta-reviewer as soon as possible so another reviewer can  be found.

### Can the results of the reviewing process be contested? 

Since NIME is a small conference with limited resources, we don’t offer a rebuttal phase for reviews. Once the reviews are released, the decisions are final.   


[^1]:  Of course, this is only a guide, and an actual review is up to the context of the review, your own knowledge, this year’s theme, etc.
